# Job Application Helper Extension [On going effort]

Searching for a job can be overwhelming, and taking notes during the process is often a challenge. That's why I'm developing the Job Application Helper Extension, a browser extension designed to streamline your job search. This tool will assist you in making this task easier, making your search more efficient and less stressful.

## Current features

**Note Taking:** Quickly add notes associated with the current URL.

**Local Storage:** Uses Chrome's local storage, eliminating the need for external database services.

**Delete Notes:** Remove individual notes or clear all notes at once.

**Future Updates:** More features will be added in future releases to enhance functionality.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the upper right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned/downloaded the extension.


## Usage
1. Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the notes panel.
2. Type your note in the input section. The extension will automatically associate the note with the current URL.
3. View or delete individual notes directly from the notes panel.
4. Use the "Delete All" button to clear all saved notes if needed.
